# setzkasten

A simple tiler to align high resolution images on an infinite zoomable plane. 
The results can be displayed with any regular mapping client that supports
XYZ tiles.

The necessity for this approach evolved when I started taking (sometimes)
gigapixel photos through focus stacking and stitching microscopy images. It is a self-hosted alternative to commercial operations like zoomify or 
easyzoom. In addition it allows you to arrange multiple images on the same
plane. Currently this happens through the configuration files.

Self-hosting this type of map is made very affordable through static file
CDN caching as for example provided by cloudflare.

This is also the code behind my own (rather modest) entomological collection:
